# Crypto Solver


## About this tool


This tool is specifically made for CTF challenges. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt using different kinds of ciphers (Mostly esoteric ciphers). This is made for faster and more convinient solving of simple cryptographics challenges.


## Why CryptoSolver

During my early years of playing CTFs, I went to a CTF which focused only on Cryptography and we were given a Windows machine to work on. This was really frustrating as we had to look around the web for different types of Ciphers online. One of the most helpful was [Rumkin](http://rumkin.com/), where most of the ciphers were present. But the problem started when the Windows machine started to breakdown because of multiple open tabs and our speed detoriated because of that<br>
After that CTF was over my partner and I thought, "Why don't we make an offline Cyptographic CTF tool which could help us tackling these types of situations? It can be a offline collection of different Cryptographics algorithms at one place". This was how the prototype for this tool was written in C language. 


## Installation 

It can be easily installed using `cargo`. There may be several warnings, which will be removed in the subsequent versions.<br>

```
cargo build
```
To build the target binary 


**OR**

Directly run the program after building : 


```
cargo run
```
